soccerCard was designed to be a Chrome extension that produces a context-card giving a quick summary of the player and
their most recent season statistics. The extension got its data from thesportsdb.com database. I will no longer be working on this
extension, this was mostly to refresh my JavaScript knowledge.

Usage
-----
The user highlights and right clicks the 'soccerCard' option from the context-menu for the card to appear. 

Tools
---------
- JavaScript
- JSON
